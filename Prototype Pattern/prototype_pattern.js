/*
P/s: The Prototype Pattern allows:
-Create many copies that shouldnâ€™t depend on the concrete classes of objects that you need to copy(means the prototype instance is a very stable object)
-Use the pattern when you want to reduce the number of subclasses that only differ in the way they initialize their respective objects

But there is a problem that every prototypes created from the prototype instance will share the same prototype stats so to avoid that we can use some special copies
